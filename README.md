# Youtube Css for Fluent Theme.

### **RECCOMENDED TO USE THE THEME WITH CAPTION WINDOW BLUR. NOT RECCOMENDED TO USE THE VERSION WITHOUT IT AS IT BLURS THE BACKGROUND OF EACH WORD, MAKING IT HIGHLY GPU INTENSIVE. IT KEEPS FLICKERING IF THE CAPTION HAS MULTIPLE EFFECTS.**

### **Yes the home page automatically hides the navigation bar on the left. For it to appear you have to click on the hamburger menu button twice after which it will work as usual.**

### **I have made it easy to toggle autohide sidebar on or off. Just follow the instruction given as comments in the css files of both the themes**

### **You can find a preview of the theme in [Preview](./Preview).**

## Notes:

*   **Does not work with Firefox because backdrop blur isnt supported.**
*   **~~Will be constantly editing~~ Thats what I thought but I had Exams. Sorry for the delay. Will continue at the earliest.**.
*   **If using the autohide nav theme theme please apply both css and javascript if you want to see the navigation menu when pressing the button.**
*   **If only css is used, navigation menu will never appear even if clicked multiple times.**
*   **This theme contains the Modern Scrollbar extension's css [Github repository of Modern Scrollbar](https://github.com/luandersonn/Modern-scrollbar)**
*   **This project is an tweaked version of a dropped stylish extentions theme called [APPLE-TUBE (BIG 2020 UPDATE)](https://userstyles.org/styles/175984/apple-tube-big-2020-update).**

## Installation and usage
**[Tutorial video by LAW-Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/embed/-bo-Z01os-s)**

You can use Stylus, Enhancer for Youtube Extension, Tweaks for YouTube Extension or any other such Extensions to apply this theme.

Go to the custom css section of the extention you use and copy paste all the contents of any of the themes in [Themes](./Themes) folder.

If using the autohide theme paste all the contents of [javascript.js](./reveal-nav-bar-javascript.js) to the custom javascript of the extension.
